[h1]Overview[/h1]
Introduces a new slot in Training Center that allows you to slot in soldiers for Conditioning Training.

Feature list:
[olist]
[*] Adds a new slot in Training Center for Conditioning Training
[*] Choose the stat that you want to improve: Aim, HP, etc.
[*] The training duration is dynamic and determined by the soldier rank, combat intelligence and base training days. Base training days is configurable.
[*] Once your soldier has completed training, he/she will gain 3 things:
[olist]
[*] Improvement to stat that were chosen - It's random and the range is configurable. The soldier's chance to gain higher roll is influenced by his/her combat intelligence.
[*] Ability points - Random ability points based on a configurable range. Also influenced by combat intelligence. I find it more interesting that lower combat intelligence will provide more Ability Points.
[*] Random abilities - The higher the combat intelligence, the more abilities you gain! The ability pool is generated depending on the soldier class:
[list]
[*] Soldier class has a random deck - The ability pool is generated by taking all abilities from the random deck + abilities defined in this mod's config. Example class pack: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1265143828]Proficiency Classes[/url].
[*] Soldier class does not have a random deck - The ability pool is generated by taking all AWC abilities + abilities defined in this mod's config. Example: Vanilla classes.
[*] Also, I have implemented measures to ensure that the pool does not contain abilities already available in the soldier's tree. This is to prevent the soldier from earning an ability already available in the tree.
[*] I have been careful not to include abilities that are dependent on equipped weapon. If you intend to add more abilities, be careful of this because your soldier might end up with useless abilities.
[/list]
[/olist]
[*] This training is very exhausting and will drain the Will of your soldiers. They will need time to recuperate depending on how long they were in there.
[*] Each soldier can only do this training one time!
[*] The randomness of what the soldier gets is 100% intentional. I feel that RNG adds some replayability as you get unique soldier builds every time you play.
[*] Basic strat that I learned, is to get Training Center up early; lower ranks don't take long to train. Colonels can take up to a month. You will have to decide though; when you train a soldier, that's one soldier less to go out on missions. And training a soldier with Average Combat Intelligence is less advantageous. 
[/olist]

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
[list]
[*] The required mods are required else this mod wouldn't work as expected. You could remove the perk packs, but you will need to configure the abilities that go into the random ability pool. Right now the abilities configured are all coming from the perk packs. Or you can simply set bUseThisAbilityList to false in this mod's XComGame.ini.
[/list]

[h1]Known Limitations / Issues[/h1]
Nothing is perfect my dear friends.
[list]
[*] If the new slot does not appear in mid-campaign installs, potentially you need to rebuild the facility. In this case, console command "GiveFacility" comes in handy.
[*] It is possible that there are issues. If you see any, please let me know :)
[/list]

[h1]Compatibilities[/h1]
LWOTC - Based on feedback, this mod works fine on a fresh campaign
RPGO - Compatible; also based on feedback
Mid campaign installs: Should be fine with Strategy Save. If Training Center is already built, the new slot should magically appear.

[h1]Companion mods[/h1]
This mod works best with its companion mods that I highly recommend you give a try
